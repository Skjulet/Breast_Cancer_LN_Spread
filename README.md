Random effects models of lymph node metastases in breast cancer: quantifying the roles of covariates and screening using a continuous growth model

By: Gabriel Isheden, Kamila Czene, and Keith Humphreys

Description:
This repository provides code for estimating breast cancer lymph node spread as a function of tumour volume and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), based on a simulated data set. The code estimates the effect of HRT on lymph node spread using equation (7) as the likelihood, based the methodology described in Section 3.1, "Covariates associated with rate of lymph node spread", of our article .
